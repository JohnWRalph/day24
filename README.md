Day24:
Combining express and Svelte (SERVER and CLIENT), as well as "cheating" with a database by using a file!

HOMEWORK:
Create a frontend with Svelte and a backend with Express, like I do in my video, for a model of "Videogames", stored in a file "videogames.json". See my video for file structure!
Your form should have:
- Name
- Platform it's on
- Year of release
- Genre
- ESRB  rating
- Boolean value of whether it's good or not.

BONUS:
Add an IMAGE FILE UPLOADER to the Form, and save it in the backend as well! ( ask for help if you need ) 

Day25:
VALIDATION!
Watch the video, then do the same thing for your Videogames app from Day24.
Validate input, return errors on the backend.
Catch them on the frontend and make your form user friendly!

Defien your own validation rules.
Some examples:
- is your input type the type you expect it to be? ie: can i pass an array instead of a string as .req.body.name and pass your validation, breaking shit?
- length checks
- bad word filters (edited)
